## "The Citrus Bar" Restaurant Page

The goal behind creating this mock restaurant page was to practice using webpack/modules and practice building pages with javascript/tabs.

## Usage

1. Download all files inside the repository.

2. Open the dist folder and then load "index.html" in your browser.

3. 
    - If you have a field you want to visit, you can click its corresponding link in the header. Clicking a link will smooth-scroll down to the corresponding location and reveal its information.
    - If there isn't a particular section you want to visit, you can scroll down and click on any title that strikes your interest to reveal its information (e.g. Menu, Reservations, About Us).

4. If you've finished reading a section and don't want to view the information anymore, click on the container's title to clear its content.
